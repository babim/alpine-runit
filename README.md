# This is a somewhat minimal image to use for your containers.
thanks faisyl

This is basically gliderlabs/alpine's Alpine Linux base image with some modification.
I've loved using phusion/baseimage for my containers, but wanted something smaller to build upon instead of ubuntu14.04, so this is my take on the solution. 
This adds runit + similar modifications as baseimage.There is a simpler startup mechanism than my_init. 
It relies on s simple shell script to dump the environment in /etc/envvars. 
All runit services you add need to source this file to gain access to the container environment. 
Similarly, instead of /etc/my_init.d for pre-service scripts to run, the startup shell script sequentially runs scripts found in /etc/runit_init.d.

```
/etc/runit_init.d
```
Please feel free to use it or build upon it as needed.
